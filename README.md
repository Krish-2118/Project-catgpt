# Smart India Hackathon 2025 — Problem Statement 25044  
**Title:** AI-Powered Crop Yield Prediction and Optimization  
**Theme / Category:** Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

---

## 📋 Problem Statement  
Develop an AI-based solution that can predict crop yields and optimize farming decisions (e.g. input usage, planting schedules) to improve productivity and sustainability for farmers.  
The solution should consider environmental variables, soil data, weather, crop type, etc., and recommend actionable insights to maximize yield and reduce waste.

---

## 🎯 Objectives & Scope  
- Predict expected yield for different crops in different fields / conditions  
- Suggest optimal input usage (water, fertilizer, pesticide)  
- Provide “what-if” scenarios: how yield changes if input or schedule is altered  
- Ensure model fairness, interpretability, and usability by farmers  
- Build a scalable, extensible, and deployable system
